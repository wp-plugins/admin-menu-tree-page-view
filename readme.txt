Get a tree view of all your pages directly in the admin menu. Edit, view and add pages - all is available just one click away!

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin adds all your pages to the admin menu, so all your pages will always be available within just one click.
You can also add pages directly in the tree and you get a search box so you quickly can find the article/page you're looking for.

Works perfect in CMS-like WordPress installations with lots of pages in a tree hierarchy.

#### More advanced page tree with drag-and-drop support
I have made an even more advanced version of the tree, where you also can search and re-order the pages. It's called 
[CMS Tree Page View](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cms-tree-page-view/).

#### Donation and more plugins

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder "cms-tree-page-view" to "/wp-content/plugins/"
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Done!

Now the tree with the pages will be visible both on the dashboard and in the menu under pages.

== Screenshots ==

1. The menu page tree with all your pages. Pretty neat, eh?
2. Since version 0.2 you can easily add new pages too. This will make you a page kung fu master.

== Changelog ==

= 0.3 =
- Removed some notices
- Added a search/filter box. Search your pages in real time. I love it! :)

= 0.2 =
- Some CSS changes. The icons and text and smaller now. I think it's better this way, you can fit so many more pages in the tree now.
- Now you can add new pages below or as a child to a page. For me this has been the feature I've missed the most.

= 0.1 =
- It's alive!
