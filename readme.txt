Get a tree view of all your pages directly in the admin menu. Search, edit, view and add pages - all with just one click away!

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin adds all your pages to the admin menu, so all your pages will always be available within just one click, 
no matter where you are in the admin area. You can also add pages directly in the tree and you can
quickly find your pages by using the search box.

Works perfect in CMS-like WordPress installations with lots of pages in a tree hierarchy.

#### More advanced page tree with drag-and-drop support
I have made an even more advanced version of the tree, where you also can search and re-order the pages. It's called 
[CMS Tree Page View](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cms-tree-page-view/).

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Done!

Now the tree with the pages will be visible in the admin menu to the left.

== Screenshots ==
