Get a tree view of all your pages directly in the admin menu. Edit, view and add pages - all is available just one click away!

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin adds all your pages to the admin menu, so all your pages will always be available within just one click.
You can also add pages directly in the tree.

Probably most suitable for CMS-like installations with lots of pages.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder "cms-tree-page-view" to "/wp-content/plugins/"
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Done!

Now the tree with the pages will be visible both on the dashboard and in the menu under pages.

== Screenshots ==

1. The menu page tree with all your pages. Pretty neat, eh?
2. Since version 0.2 you can easily add new pages too. This will make you a page kung fu master.

== Changelog ==

= 0.2 =
- Some CSS changes. The icons and text and smaller now. I think it's better this way, you can fit so many more pages in the tree now.
- Now you can add new pages below or as a child to a page. For me this has been the feature I've missed the most.

= 0.1 =
- It's alive!
